# TensorFlow Certification Preparation

I am interested in the Bioinformatics field, as I have an interest in Biology and of course software development. When I saught out advice on the skills needed for Bioinformatics, my lack of formal Biology background was described as lacking. In addition, there was a desire for mastery in TensorFlow or Pytorch Machine Learning modules. 

I have taken several Machine Learning classes, but ML classes at Universities kinda suck. Do NOT take ML at Arizona State University. The ML Professor's there are incompetent. That said, while I did learn some theory, and writing ML algorithm in university, I felt what was lacking was formal expertise in modules like Tensorflow or Pytorch. In addition, I felt that I would have trouble solving any Kaggle dataset for Machine Learning. Therefore, I decided to study TensorFlow, a popular Google ML module, and take the time to solve problems with it. As part of that, I signed up for ZTM's TensorFlow Certification Prep Course on Udemy. You will find here a lot of the work I did as part of study associated with the class. In addition, you will find some other files that were meant for my learning, and sharing with my friends.
